### Hi there, I'm Alabo David Briggs 👋🏼

<br/>

If there is a table, I want to be on it. That shows you how commited I can be if I am interested.<br/>
I am greatful that right now my biggest problems is ensuring my next PR adds more value to a users live.
<br/>
I am working towards getting to a point where being a billonaire isn't what I aim for. See truth is, you will hear my name again so long you are on the internet.
<br/>
Want me in your team?
Truth is if I like your idea and you are willing to listen then I will be the best teammate. 
<br/>
